# GEE MegaCourse Learning Log

This repository documents my hands-on learning progress through the [Google Earth Engine (GEE) Mega Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-earth-engine-gis-remote-sensing/). Each section is organized by topic and includes code samples, notes, and output visualizations.

---

## Purpose

- Build a consistent learning record while progressing through the course  
- Summarize key concepts in Earth Engine JavaScript API  
- Maintain reproducible examples for future reference  
- Share foundational materials with others interested in remote sensing + GEE
