#  Image Visualization with Landsat 9 â€“ GEE Learning Log

This note summarizes what was learned in **Section 5 - Lecture 10: Image Visualization** of the [Google Earth Engine Mega Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/google-earth-engine-gis-remote-sensing/learn/lecture/42661196#overview).

## What This Script Does
- Loads Landsat 9 imagery for early 2022
- Filters by region of interest (Utah, USA) and date range
- Sorts by cloud cover and selects the clearest image
- Displays the image using two visualizations:
  - **True Color (432)**: Natural RGB view
  - **False Color (543)**: Highlights vegetation (commonly used in remote sensing)

## Key GEE Concepts Used

| Concept                | Purpose                                     |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `ee.Geometry.Point`    | Define region of interest (ROI)             |
| `ee.ImageCollection`   | Load Landsat image series                   |
| `.filterDate()`        | Limit to a specific time range              |
| `.filterBounds()`      | Limit to area around the ROI                |
| `.sort("CLOUD_COVER")` | Prefer less cloudy images                   |
| `.first()`             | Pick the clearest available image           |
| `Map.addLayer()`       | Display imagery with color visualization    |
| `Map.centerObject()`   | Zoom to the image area                      |

## Notes

### Why are `min` and `max` parameters required?

Earth observation imagery (like Landsat) stores data in numeric values that represent the intensity of light reflected by the Earth's surface. 
But GEE canâ€™t automatically know how to visualize this unless we tell it the range of brightness values to stretch between black and white.

- `min`: defines the darkest value (anything below appears black)
- `max`: defines the brightest value (anything above appears white)
- Values between `min` and `max` are mapped into visible colors on screen

Landsat 9 surface reflectance typically ranges from 0 to ~20000, so specifying:

```javascript
min: 0, max: 20000
```
helps make the image look clear and balanced â€” not too dark or washed out.
